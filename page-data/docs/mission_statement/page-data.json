In the absence of a nation-state, many things are of key importance to one's survival; things that threaten a nation's survival. Large nations increase individuals' dependence on the state, whether by design or because of the road to hell being paved with good intentions. A dependence on the state means there is less need for societal responsibility. When there is no or little societal responsibility the state needs to step in; creating a detrimental feedback loop.</p>\n<p>Consumerism, by encouraging us to buy every new thing, has encouraged self-sufficiency in the form of DIY. The Internet by making knowledge accessible has done the same. Homesteading is a means to independence but has not been encouraged. Homesteading is an involved task and requires time. Time is money, and time should be spent with family; things that can be automated should be.</p>\n<p>Certain uncertainties and possible future scenarios increase the importance of self-sufficiency, and the direction of some technologies will be enablers of it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Government losing control of monetary policy, and TAX revenue.</li>\n<li>Break down of law. Police forces, by admission, selectively enforce the law. This means lawmakers are no-longer the lawmakers. As some laws are more beneficial to enforce than others, there is a breakdown of common law, and with it a growing need for militias and private gun ownership. As laws are only written for law-abiding citizens there is little downside to responsible law-abiding citizens owning guns for protection.</li>\n<li>Civil wars, as a consequence of a major war being unlikely due to the stake being so high, come about due to tactics of sophisticated cold war.</li>\n<li>Artificial intelligence, is a disruptive technology unlike any other before it. History repeating itself is mostly a platitude. With A.I. you are not increasing efficiency (efficiency, along with ideas, being the only legitimate source of new wealth), you are making humans obsolete; doctors, accountants, system administrators. Robots offer efficiency, but the complexity, initial cost, knowledge, upkeep cost, and space will likely prevent robots in small business; meaning that goods and services provided by these companies will be highly prized.</li>\n<li>Energy production has the potential to become ever more localized, should material science progresses, which it will because humans are amazing.</li>\n<li>3D printing, could lead to production becoming ever more localized, and coupled with open-source culture, many business models will collapse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Pretending that housing isn't an issue; increased self-sufficiency is always the answer to increased uncertainty. It is hard to homestead and be self-sufficient without housing. Three groups of solutions are; markets decide, charity, government action. The first speaks to the human soul, in the sense of to <em>live</em>, in the literal sense of the word. The latter two are likewise to degrees soul-crushing.</p>\n<p>Free markets are only free as long as everyone isn't free to merely chose to play by the rules. Fiat money is a confidence game that keeps the gears turning. Only a small proportion of people are motivated to work by the work that they are doing. From that, there is an implication for concepts of a universal basic income. If active management harms the health of a system, and control over the monetary system has only weakened, the extrapolation is simple. Cryptocurrencies have promise as they represent global monetary governance without ill governance from humans. Would the explosion of enterprise seen in the 20C happen had there not been fiat money? If not the usefulness of digital money with set in stone rules is limited. The manipulation of fiat represents the spiritual aspect of the economy. A middle ground between rigidity and flexibility should be strived for. Alternatively, history shows that it is those that are prepared who survive a crisis.</p>\n<p>States around the world had been in a game, and a few used the game to their advantage, eventually leading to the normalization of money printing policies. If equilibrium is not achievable within the rules of a game, you must change the rules of the game to make it achievable. By becoming self-sufficient we are changing the rules, and preparing for uncertainty.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 30, 2020","title":"Mission Statement"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/docs/mission_statement/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
